### Tic Tac Toe Game

####  Aim
To implement a simple **Tic Tac Toe game** in C++ that allows a human player to play against a basic computer AI.

####  Algorithm Used — Game Flow
a. Initialize a 3×3 board with empty cells.
b. Alternate turns between player 1 and player 2 (or computer).
c. For each move:

Check if the move is valid.

Place the symbol (X or O).

Check for a win or draw condition.
d. If the computer is playing, make a move based on predefined logic (e.g., blocking or random choice).
e. End when a player wins or the board is full.


#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(9)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

####  Use Cases
- Demonstrates **game theory and AI decision-making**.
- Foundation for implementing **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta pruning**.
- Useful for **AI strategy design** and **reinforcement learning basics**.
